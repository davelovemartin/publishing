Since reading ["A Guide to the Good Life - The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy"](https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/embed?asin=B0040JHNQG&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_8yynAbE21Z9TZ&tag=justan0therda-21), I've become happier, successfully practiced self-control, and found my relationships are filled with more intensity and joy. In the book, author William B. Irvine introduces Stoic teachings as a set of rules for how we can live our lives. Rules that help guide us to happiness. I'll introduce you to Stoicism by sharing with you my summary of the book, and a reflection of how it has affected me. You too can live the Good Life just by taking onboard and practising the techniques coined by the Stoics.

The definition of *being stoic* has changed over the years. The Stoics weren't passive individuals resigned to being on the receiving end of the world’s abuse and injustice. They worked hard to make the world a better place.

The Stoics were acute observers of the workings of the human mind.  As a result they became some of the most insightful psychologists of the ancient world. The Stoics realised that a life plagued with negative emotions wasn't much fun. So, they looked for joy in the simplest areas of everyday life and developed techniques for preventing negative emotions before (or as) they arise.

### Negative Visualisation

Humans are unhappy because we are insatiable. We lust after things. But after working hard to get what we want, we lose interest in the object of our desire more often than not. We take for granted what we accumulate and those whose company we keep. To counteract this, the Stoics recommend that we take some time out to imagine that we have lost what we value.

This negative visualisation technique teaches us to embrace life, and enjoy it while we can. Yet it also prepares us for changes that may deprive us of the people and things that we love. Contemplate the impermanence of everything in the world. Enjoy what you have without clinging to it. Recognise when we spend time with someone, it could be for the last time. Because sometimes fate deals you an unfair hand, you need to prepare yourself for anything. Recognising this imparts everything we do with a significance and intensity that would otherwise be absent. We will no longer sleepwalk through our life.

I've found meditating on the transient nature of life to be melancholic, but bittersweet. Yes, I've shed a few tears imagining the loss of those dear to me, but the benefits of such a powerful technique justifies this sadness. I now make the most of the time with my loved ones, I appreciate them so much more and *dial up* how I connect with them.

Stoic philosophy, while teaching us to be satisfied with whatever we’ve got, also counsels us to seek certain things in life. We should, for example, strive to become better people — to become virtuous in the ancient sense of the word.
An important part of [what the stoics saw as] our function, is to work with and for our fellow men. We were designed to live among other people and interact with them in a manner that is mutually advantageous. Marcus Aurelius, stoic and Roman Emporer, concludes that doing his social duty will give him the best chance at having a good life: 

> “I am bound to do good to my fellow-creatures and bear with them... We should *show true love* to the people with whom destiny has surrounded us”.

### Voluntarily Forgo Opportunities for Pleasure and Comfort

They say money can't buy happiness. It's your state of mind that matters, not your bank balance. The Stoics teach that those who eschew luxury can devote the same time and energy needed to attain luxury to other, more worthwhile undertakings. The Stoics are not alone in making this observation. Lao Tzu (founder of Taoism) observed “he who knows contentment is rich.”

The Stoics realised that the act of forgoing pleasure can itself be pleasant. Intense pleasures, when captured by us, become our captors. And the more pleasures a man has, "The more masters he has to serve". Learn self-control by making a point of passing up an opportunity to drink. If you refrain from drinking that glass of wine, you will experience pleasure of a different kind. As Epictetus observes, you will “be pleased and will praise yourself” for not drinking. Now the simple act of passing up a drink or a piece of cake gives me a little wave of self-satisfaction. It's nice. Try it.

### Stop Worrying (About What You Can't Control)

We are evolutionarily wired to be worriers. Our ancestors that sat around blissfully enjoying the sunset, instead of fretting about the growling noise in the trees, probably didn’t live to a ripe old age. We've retained our ancestors’ tendency to worry even though it's no longer as useful to us. Our minds dwell on anything and everything. Negative emotions flood your mind and sometimes it's hard to stop the rot. I've realised that when I'm tired, I'm more susceptible to negative thoughts. Having had this insight, I can dismiss them. I use my reasoning powers to say to myself - "I'm tired, that's a silly thought" and I don't dwell on it. Think of thoughts as passing clouds in the sky, watch them drift off and forget about them.

We spend a lot of time concerned about things we can't possibly have much influence on. What we must do is determine which are the things we cannot control. If things are beyond our control, and there is nothing we can do, we might as well focus on the things we can control, and do our best at doing them. Doing this will improve our chances of gaining tranquility. This is Derren Brown's main point in an [interview with Andy Zaltzman on Radio 4](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05nbzfh), and is worth a listen. Brown says, "Don't emotionally commit to an outcome that you can't completely control. What you can commit yourself to, is doing everything you can do to change that thing".

Being happy all the time isn't possible.  But we can seek contentment. It is better and easier to change yourself and what you want than it is to change the world around you. My goal in running a race, for example, is not to win the race but to run the best race that I can run. I know that I'm not going to beat someone who trains 6-days-a-week, when I only train 3. By letting go, the Stoic's goal is not to change the world, but to do their best to bring about certain changes. Even if your efforts prove to be ineffectual, you can say that you have done what you could do.

Another trap that we fall into, is spending a lot of time worrying about what might have been. We need to realise what has happened is in the past, is now beyond our control. There's no point crying over spilt milk. The Stoics dealt with this by taking it for granted that they had a fate. They rationalised that events turned out how they did, because they were supposed to be that way. By not comparing what happens to us, with what could of, and by avoiding "if only" thoughts, we live in the moment. Okay. So sometimes we *should* think about the past to learn lessons that can help us in our efforts to shape the future. However, we are wasting our time if we worry about past or present events. By believing it is our destiny to live a certain life, the Stoics think, we will make our current situation, whatever it may be, more tolerable.

As well as the techniques, Irvine dedicates part of the book to explain the history of Stoicism and then several chapters of how the Stoics dealt with different stages of life and situations involving other people. My favourite was on ***how to deal with insults***...

The Stoics advise us to consider whether the insult angers us because the insult is actually true. Suppose that someone mocks you for being bald when, in fact, you are bald! "Why is it an insult," Seneca asks, “to be told what is self-evident?". 

Seneca also says we should describe those who insult us as overgrown children. A Stoic sage, were one to exist, would take the insults of his fellow humans, to be like the barking of a dog. When a dog barks, the dog in question appears to dislike us. But we don't go through the rest of the day thinking, “Oh, dear! That dog doesn’t like me!“

Irvine warns practising Stoicism won’t be easy. It takes effort to practice negative visualisation. Practicing self-denial will test you.  But, if you have a philosophy of life, decision making is made straightforward.

Seneca advises that we meditate each night on the events of the day. Wow did we respond to situations? Did we respond as the Stoics would have done? How can we do better tomorrow? We can also devote part of our meditations to going through a kind of mental checklist. Are we practicing the psychological techniques recommended by the Stoics? Do we engage in negative visualisation on a daily basis? Have we practiced acts of self-denial? Have we refrained from dwelling on the past and instead focused our attention on the future?

Although I've not long finished the book, I am much more content with my lot. Going day-to-day not looking back, but forward with an attitude of doing what I can, is inspiring. I don't know whether this book has had this profound effect on me on its own, or whether it has come along at a good time in my journey of self-discovery. But I do know that I'm very lucky to be able to live my life in the way that I do and I'm grateful for those people around me. It is a good life.

I  recommend supporting the author and reading this book which you can buy [here](https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/embed?asin=B0040JHNQG&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_8yynAbE21Z9TZ&tag=justan0therda-21).
